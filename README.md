My solutions to the Project Euler problems

The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems that follow. The [archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) table shows how many people have solved each problem; as a general rule of thumb the more who have solved it, the easier the problem. To assist further there is a difficulty rating system which may also help decide where to start.
